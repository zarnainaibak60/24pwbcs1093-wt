# Lab 03 & 04 — CSS Fundamentals

- The exercises demonstrate basic to intermediate CSS techniques: selectors, typography, backgrounds, box model, transitions, effects, responsive design, and small components.
- Recent updates include a redesigned `styles/main.css` (modern, responsive theme) and improved responsive rules for the schedule table (`styles/schedule.css`). If you maintain local copies, clear the browser cache when testing.
