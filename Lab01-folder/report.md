# Lab 01

During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control. I created an HTML file and used Git to track the changes I made. I also learned how to add comments in HTML and how to use the `.gitignore` file to tell Git which files to ignore.

One of the most interesting parts was creating a new branch. I used the branch to make changes without affecting the main project. Later, I merged it back into the main branch. This helped me understand how teams work on different features at the same time.

Overall, this lab helped me understand the basics of Git, such as committing, pushing, creating branches, and merging. I feel more confident now about using Git in future projects.
